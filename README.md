<!-- Brief -->
<p align="center">
Welcome to the IP Address Tracker! This web application, updated with TypeScript from version 1.0.1, lets you search for IP addresses and domains, providing essential information and geolocation details with a map view. Using Leaflet maps, TypeScript, Sass, and HTML, the app offers a smooth and responsive user experience. Additionally, interactive popups give friendly feedback in case of errors.

## Key Features

Users should be able to:

- See their own IP address on the map when the page loads
- Search for any IP addresses or domains to view key information and location
- **Bonus:** Interactive Popup/Dialog - Receive feedback popups for errors or invalid inputs
- View the optimal layout for each page based on their device's screen size

## Built with

- TypeScript (updated from v1.0.1)
- [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) - JavaScript library for interactive maps
- Sass
- HTML5
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) - Module bundler for JavaScript

## What I Learned

During the development of this project, which has been updated with TypeScript from version 1.0.1, I enhanced my error handling skills, particularly with APIs. Managing errors and providing user feedback through interactive popups was a valuable learning experience.

I also focused on improving code organization by separating functions and functionalities into different TypeScript files. This approach increased maintainability and made the codebase easier to understand and work with.
